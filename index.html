    <h1>Dear Mom,</h1>
    <p class="writer">First off, Happy Mothers Day. I'm not sure what to write you. You've been there for me for so long that it seems that words cannot describe my affection for you. Even though I wasn't with you today, I am glad to be with you now!
      <br>
      Today is the day that I celebrate you, for everything that you do or love me for. All of those things that made me who I am. 
      <br>
      It seems that for most people, mother's day shows some small appreciation, sometimes flowers or something cute. It always seems that those things never have any affection originating from them. But you deserve such more, you are so very special. Doing things that no sane person could ever do, and I love you.
      <br>
      Honestly at this point I don't know what to write, I just know that no matter what happens you will be there for me, you are always there for me and you will always be the most important person in my life. You are my mother, and I love you. Happy mother's day mom.</p>

    <h1 class="endtext"> Love, The SterDad</h1>
